# `build` directory

This directory serves to **aggregate pure HTML documents, their corresponding stylesheets, scripts, and asset files**. They are to be converted to PHP when each HTML page is finalized and would then be transfered to the `public/` directory.

**This directory is solely for development**. You won't find this directory in the server the website is hosted.

## What to include?

- `pages/` directory with `.html` files
- `styles/` directory with `.css` files
- `scripts/` directory with `.js` files
- `assets/` directory containing resources like images, icons, fonts, etc.
- `components/` directory containing reusable components (i.e., header, footer).

Create folders within them when needed for organization.
